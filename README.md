# Lego collection keeper

This project came from my love of LEGO and my desire to keep track of my collection. I have a lot of LEGO sets and I wanted a way to easily keep track of what I have and what I'm missing. I also wanted to learn more about React, Vite, and MUI, so I decided to create this project.

I used React to create the user interface and Vite to build and serve the application. I also used MUI to style the application and make it look nice. I chose these tools because I wanted to learn more about them and because they are all great tools for building web applications.

I hope you find this project useful and enjoy using it! Let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to contribute to the project.
